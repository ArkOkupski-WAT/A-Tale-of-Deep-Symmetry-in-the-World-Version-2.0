This work presents a radical geometric model where **spacetime itself has polarization** and particles emerge as compact geometric configurations.

### 🔑 Key Insights

- **Geometric Polarization**: Spacetime has intrinsic +/- states like a coin
- **Neutron vs Antineutron**: Difference is purely geometric, not charge-based
- **CPT Symmetry**: Emerges from geometric-conventional interchangeability

### 🎯 The Neutron Breakthrough

The model explains why neutron and antineutron have opposite beta decays despite both being neutral
